If that adage holds any weight, then without question - stem to stern the iPhone is the most important camera on the planet. And our industry shows it, too.</p>\n\n<p>On a vacation? It didn’t happen if it’s not documented on your Instagram story with several candid shots.</p>\n\n<p>Breaking nows? Check Twitter and see what outlets are reporting on by peeping their photos of an event unfolding in real time.</p>\n\n<p>Etcetera.</p>\n\n<p>But for all of their ubiquity on the platform, the act of showing them in a performant and memory conservative manner is often a mismanaged endeavor. With a little know how as to what’s happening in UIKit and why in regards to how it treats images, one can gain some massive savings and forgo the unrelenting wrath of jetsam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"in-theory\">In Theory</h3>\n<p>Pop quiz - how much memory will this 266 kilobyte (and quite dashing) photo of my beautiful daughter require in an iOS app?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/baylor.jpg\" alt=\"Baylor\" /></p>\n\n<p>Spoiler alert - it’s not 266 kilobytes. It’s not 2.66 megabytes. It’s around <em>14 megabytes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>iOS essentially derives its memory hit from images from their <em>dimensions</em> - whereas the actual file size has much less to do with it. And the dimensions for this photo sit at 1718 pixels wide by 2018 pixels tall. Each pixel will cost us four bytes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"mf\">1718*2048*</span><span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"mi\">1000000</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">14.07</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Imagine if you’ve got a table view with a list of users, and each row shows the now pervasive circle avatar of their photo to the left. If you’re thinking things are kosher because each one has been packed up nice and tight from ImageOptim or something similar, that might not be the case. If each one is a conservative 256x256 you could still be taking quite a hit on memory.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-rendering-pipeline\">The Rendering Pipeline</h3>\n<p>All that to say - it’s worth knowing what’s going on under the hood. When you load up an image, it’s going to be processed in three steps:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Load</strong> - iOS takes the compressed image and loads (in our example) the 266 kilobyte into memory. Really no worries yet.<br />\n2) <strong>Decode</strong> - Now, iOS takes the image and converts into a way the GPU can read and understand. It’s now uncompressed, and it’s here we’re at the 14MB size listed above. <br />\n3) <strong>Render</strong> - Just like it sounds, the image data is ready and willing to be rendered any which way. Even if it’s just by a 60 by 60 point image view.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The decoding phase is the big one. Here, iOS has created a buffer - specifically an image buffer, that’s got an in-memory representation of the image. So it stands to reason that this size is intrinsically tied to the proportions of the image itself and not its file size. This paints a clear picture of why the dimensions are so important when it comes to your memory consumption when working with images.</p>\n\n<p>For <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> in particular, when we give it image data we received from a network hit or some other source, it decodes that data buffer to whatever compression the data says it’s encoded in (think PNG or JPEG). However, it’ll actually hang onto it as well. Since rendering is not a one shot operation, the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> keeps that image buffer around so it’s only decoding things one time.</p>\n\n<p>Expanding on this idea - one integral buffer for any iOS app is its frame buffer. This is what’s responsible for actually showing your iOS app as it appears on screen since it holds the rendered output of its contents. The display hardware on any iOS device uses this per-pixel information to literally illuminate the very pixels on the physical screen.</p>\n\n<p>And timing matters here. To get the buttery smooth 60 frames per second scrolling, the frame buffer will need to have UIKit render the app’s window and it’s subsequent subviews into it when their information changes (i.e. assigning an image to an image view). If you do that slow, you drop a frame.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Think 1/60th of a second is short on time? Pro Motion devices up the ante to 1/120th of a second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"size-does-matter\">Size Does Matter</h3>\n<p>We can visualize this process and memory being consumed pretty easily. Using the picture of my daughter, I created a trivial app that shows an image view with that exact image within it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">filePath</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Bundle</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">main</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">path</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forResource</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">\"baylor\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">ofType</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"jpg\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">url</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSURL</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">fileURLWithPath</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">filePath</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">fileImage</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIImage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">contentsOfFile</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">filePath</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Image view</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">imageView</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIImageView</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">image</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">fileImage</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">contentMode</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">scaleAspectFit</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">widthAnchor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">constraint</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">equalToConstant</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">300</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isActive</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">heightAnchor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">constraint</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">equalToConstant</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">400</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isActive</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">addSubview</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">centerXAnchor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">constraint</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">equalTo</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">centerXAnchor</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isActive</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imageView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">centerYAnchor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">constraint</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">equalTo</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">view</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">centerYAnchor</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isActive</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mind the force unwraps in production. Here we’re using a simple example scenario.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which gives us this:\n<img src=\"../assets/images/baylorPhone.jpg\" alt=\"Baylor\" /></p>\n\n<p>A quick trip to LLDB shows us the image dimensions we’re working with, even though we’re using a much smaller image view to display it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"kt\">UIImage</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mh\">0x600003d41a40</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"mi\">1718</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2048</span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>A remember - that’s in <em>points</em>. So if I’m on a 3x or 2x device then you could potentially multiply that number even more so. Let’s take a quick trip down <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">vmmap</code> to see if we can confirm that around 14 megabytes are being used from this one image:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">vmmap</span> <span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">summary</span> <span class=\"n\">baylor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">memgraph</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>A few things stick out (truncated for brevity):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">Physical</span> <span class=\"nv\">footprint</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>         <span class=\"mf\">69.5</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">Physical</span> <span class=\"nf\">footprint</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">peak</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>  <span class=\"mf\">69.7</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>We’re sitting at almost 70 megabytes which gives us a nice baseline to confirm any refactor against. If we grep down into Image IO we can likely see some of the cost of our image as well:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">vmmap</span> <span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">summary</span> <span class=\"n\">baylor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">memgraph</span> <span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">grep</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Image IO\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">Image</span> <span class=\"kt\">IO</span>  <span class=\"mf\">13.4</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>   <span class=\"mf\">13.4</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>   <span class=\"mf\">13.4</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>    <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>  <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>  <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>   <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>  <span class=\"mi\">2</span> \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Ah - there’s about 14 megabytes of dirty memory right there. That’s what our back-of-the-napkin math hypothesized our image would cost. For context, here’s a quick screenshot of Terminal to clearly illustrate what each column means since they were omitted from our greppin’:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/vmmap.jpg\" alt=\"Baylor\" /></p>\n\n<p>So clearly, we’re paying the full cost of the image in our 300 x 400 image view at this point. The size of the image can be key, but it’s also not the only thing that matters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"color-space\">Color Space</h3>\n<p>Part of the memory you’ll be requesting for is determined by yet another important factor - the color space. In the example above we made an assumption that likely isn’t the case with most iPhones - that the image was utilizing the sRGB format. The 4 bytes per pixel is figured up by giving one byte for red, blue, green and the alpha component.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re shooting with a device that supports the wide color format (for example, an iPhone 8+ or iPhone X) then you likely can double the hit across the board. Of course, the reverse is true as well. Metal can use the Alpha 8 format which has only a single channel to its name.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a lot to manage and think about. This is one reason why you should use <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/UIGraphicsImageRenderer\" target=\"_blank\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</a> instead of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions</code>. The latter will <em>always</em> use sRGB which means you could miss the wide format if you <a href=\"https://instagram-engineering.com/bringing-wide-color-to-instagram-5a5481802d7d\" target=\"_blank\">want it</a>, or miss out on the savings if you’re going smaller. As of iOS 12, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code> is going to pick the right one for you.</p>\n\n<p>Lest we forget, a lot of images that crop up aren’t really of the photographed variety but rather trivial drawing operations.

Think portraits, landscape shots and more.</p>\n\n<p>The issue is that some engineers might think (and, logically so) that simply downscaling them via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> will suffice. But it typically won’t due to the reasons above, and it’s also not as performant due to internal coordinate space transforms according to Apple’s Kyle Howarth.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> becomes an issue here primarily because it will decompress the <em>original image</em> into memory as we discussed when looking at the rendering pipeline.

In session 219, “Images and Graphics Best Practices” from WWDC 18, Apple engineer Kyle Sluder showed an interesting way to control when decoding happens by using the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately</code> flag:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nf\">downsampleImage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">at</span> <span class=\"kt\">URL</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSURL</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">maxSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Float</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIImage</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">sourceOptions</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceShouldCache</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">false</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">CFDictionary</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">source</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGImageSourceCreateWithURL</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">URL</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">CFURL</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">sourceOptions</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">downsampleOptions</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                             <span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">maxSize</span>\n                             <span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                             <span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                             <span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">CFDictionary</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">downsampledImage</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">source</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">downsampleOptions</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIImage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">cgImage</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">downsampledImage</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Here Core Graphics won’t bother decoding the image until you specifically ask for the thumbnail. Also, take care to pass <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailMaxPixelSize</code> as we’ve done in both examples because if you don’t - you’re getting back a thumbnail which is the same size of the image. From the docs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“…if a maximum pixel size isn’t specified, then the thumbnail will be the size of the full image, which probably isn’t what you want.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what happened? In short, we created a much smaller decoded image buffer than before by putting the shrinking part of equation into a thumbnail. Thinking back on our rendering pipeline, for the first part (the load) we instead passed an image buffer that represented only the size of the image view we’re showing it in instead of reflecting the entire image’s dimensions for the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> to decode.</p>\n\n<p>Want a TL;DR for this entire article? Look for opportunities to downsample images instead of using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> to downscale them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bonus-points\">Bonus Points</h3>\n<p>I personally use this in tandem with the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdatasourceprefetching?language=swift\">prefetch API</a> introduced in iOS 11. Remember that we’re inherently introducing spikes in CPU usage since we’re decoding images even if we’re doing it ahead of when the table or collection view might need our cell.</p>\n\n<p>Since iOS is efficient at managing power demand when there is a constant need for it and in this case it’ll likely be intermittent, it’s good to hop on your own queue to tackle something like this. This also moves the decoding to the background, which is another significant win.</p>\n\n<p>Cover your eyes, Objective-C code sample from my side project incoming:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift

Why spend time going over an API that hasn’t seen significant changes circa 2011?</p>\n\n<p>It seemed like the session was being conducted by a preacher with no pulpit. However, with the recently announced iPad Pro sporting USB-C 3.1 capabilities, the missing context is now present. Today, let’s talk about supporting external displays in our iOS apps.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"window-quotes\">Window Quotes</h3>\n<p>It all begins with a homologically titled object in UIKit, the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIWindow</code>, and respecting the responsibilities that it represents. At its core, a window acts as a container for anything that should be on screen. We often don’t think of it much beyond its initial setup within the app delegate:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nf\">application</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"nv\">application</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIApplication</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</span> <span class=\"nv\">launchOptions</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">]?)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">Bool</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">controller</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">ViewController</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"n\">window</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIWindow</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">window</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rootViewController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">controller</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">window</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">makeKeyAndVisible</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If your app uses storyboards, the above is done for you. This is one reason why Xcode templates its app delegate objects with a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIWindow</code> property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that, we end up with a hierarchy that is stacked up like so, from bottom to top:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Device</li>\n  <li>Window</li>\n  <li>View (from the window’s root controller)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Typically, it’s fine to move on and not think much about it. A window won’t do anything more than pass on any relevant events to its root controller (which in turn travels the down responder chain with its associated views). It provides no visible content of its own, merely acting as a harbinger of sorts for things happenings that would affect its root controller.</p>\n\n<p>But its utility lies in the fact that your iOS app can break free from the confines of an any iPhone or iPad (…or iPod touch, I guess) by way of being connected to another display.</p>\n\n<p>And Apple <em>really</em> wants us to know that the new iPad Pro is ready for such occasions. By default, when iOS detects another screen UIKit will mirror the key window’s contents. But, look at the marketing for the Pro:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/lookNewScreen.jpg\" alt=\"External Display\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you inspect the image closer you’ll notice that what’s showing on the monitor versus what’s on the iPad are <em>different</em>. <strong>This</strong> is the opportunity Apple wants developers to be aware of. Let’s walk through it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-setup\">The Setup</h3>\n<p>When thinking about how to be a first class citizen for supporting external displays, there really isn’t much involved from an engineering perspective. In the aforementioned WWDC session, three main concerns are laid out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Connectivity: Handling the presence of another display.</li>\n  <li>Behavior: How your app should respond to that connection.</li>\n  <li>Connection Transitions: Handling the removal of another display.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"connectivity\">Connectivity</h3>\n<p>The first logical step is to be aware of when one should prepare interfaces for an external display. UIKit offers us two discrete responsibilities to consider. The first is the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIScreen</code> singleton, which has an array of screens the app is tracking:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"k\">var</span> <span class=\"nv\">screens</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScreen</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"k\">get</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is where we can snag a reference to the screen we need. In addition to housing a controller and its views, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIWindow</code> also has an assignable <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIScreen</code> property. With it, we can control which screen each window should display its contents on.</p>\n\n<p>The process looks similar to the following:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">externalScreen</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIScreen</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">screens</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">last</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">externalWindow</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIWindow</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">externalWindow</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">screen</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">externalScreen</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">externalWindow</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rootViewController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIViewController</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">externalWindow</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isHidden</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By default, a window’s screen property is set to the hardware’s current screen. For a window that’ll show unique content on an external display, set it before you show the window as switching screens on an already displayed window carries significant performance costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s at this point that you’d want to supply the relevant content to the new window’s <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">rootViewController</code> property. So, for the image above showing the iPad Pro, Apple has created a controller that just shows the primary content and not the editing tools below it (as on the iPad’s screen).</p>\n\n<p>The execution is easy to follow, but knowing when to do the work above is accomplished by way of Cocoa Touch’s oldest broadcasting network - <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSNotification</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, there are two:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSNotification.Name.UIScreenDidConnect</code></li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSNotification.Name.UIScreenDidDisconnect</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you were wondering why we set the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">screen</code> property on the window to the last instance in the array, this is why.

All of that interactivity will still be driven by the iOS device. This means that you’ll want to set things up accordingly, likely reserving all this new screen real estate to display the marquee parts of your content.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why is simple - the external display likely won’t have touch controls. I say likely because, to wit, the only way I suppose it <em>could</em> is if it’s another iOS device using external display software.</p>\n\n<p>Unlikely edge case notwithstanding, the main idea is that it’s a giant projected display, so treat it like one:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">extDisplayShowing</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">presentContentOnExternalDisplay</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">else</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">contentDisplayController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIContentDisplayViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">with</span> <span class=\"nv\">content</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">navigationController</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">pushViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">contentDisplayController</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">animated</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The paradigm is different. This is your chance to show off the most important, public components of your content while ensuring control of said content stays snuggly nestled within the iOS device.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"connection-transitions\">Connection Transitions</h3>\n<p>The last piece laid out by the fine engineers of Cupertino during the session was this idea of “connection transitions”, but really it’s chiefly concerned with the first step.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, as iOS engineers there is one thing we must always strive to keep for users: context.</p>\n\n<p>It’s incredibly frustrating to use an app that doesn’t respect it. Tap a row with a disclosure indicator, and instead of pushing onto the navigation stack you get some off beat modal transition. Or if there is a side menu, tapping it <em>does</em> do a push. It’s weird, and you know it when you see it. Ambiguity in software is inherently taxing to the end user, so it’s best to avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>When you receive a connect or disconnect notice, strive to keep the current context and flow of your app maintained. For our example above, it might look  something like this :</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NotificationCenter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">addObserver</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forName</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScreenDidDisconnect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">object</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">disconnectNotice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">contentDisplayController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIContentDisplayViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">with</span> <span class=\"nv\">content</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">navigationController</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">pushViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">contentDisplayController</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">animated</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">NotificationCenter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">addObserver</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forName</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScreenDidConnect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">object</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">connectNotice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">presentContentOnExternalDisplay</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If your app is suspended when a notification arrives, UIKit delivers it when your app begins running again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s about thinking of any context that <em>could</em> be lost from any of these transitions that should later be restored. So, be thinking about currently selected index paths, selected content or view hierarchies that you might need to do some bookkeeping for to later restore.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-and-why\">When, and Why</h3>\n<p>To me, real craftsmanship shows through when external display support is provided in a way that, forgive my stereotypical phrase - truly enhances the app’s experience.</p>\n\n<p>Think of Keynote. The iOS app can turn into a clicker to present the slides, or a game that houses controls locally on the phone but projects meaningful game play on your giant TV. External display support really shines here - whereas an app like <a href=\"https://www.streaksworkout.com\" target=\"_blank\">Streaks Workout</a> does just fine with mirroring its contents. It doesn’t stand to gain anything by providing any other support to external displays.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a matter of real life access control. Public or private. Your iOS device is almost always private. All of us get a little nervous when projecting it onto a huge screen in the office to show just that <em>one</em> picture. But like programming, we must consider context. The external display is public - so ask yourself what your app might stand to gain, if anything, by making content publicly shown that’s entirely unique to its display.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>If hipster culture has taught us anything, perhaps its unintentional wisdom shows us that sometimes what’s old is new again. Supporting external windows doesn’t require any shiny new API, and the process of how to do it isn’t lighting up your Twitter feed.</p>\n\n<p>But the core ethos of iOS development is marrying hardware with software, and promoting their tight coupling with startlingly efficient execution. So I would submit to you, supporting and coding against external display support is absolutely nothing new - but it is more <em>relevant</em> to us than it was before <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/new-ipad-pro-with-all-screen-design-is-most-advanced-powerful-ipad-ever/\">Apple’s event</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

Among them, digital photography is one of the more exciting bits of its history. It’s still quite a nascent craft, with its history tracing back to as recently as 1957 when the fine folks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology slapped a photo into computer memory.</p>\n\n<p>The translation from the analog to the digital was an inflection point. We’ve experienced a similar shift on iOS starting with iOS 10, though many engineers have yet to discover or adopt the latest innovation for drawing images — <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setting-the-cgcontext\">Setting the (CG)Context</h3>\n<p>Core Graphics, based on the Quartz drawing engine, has provided iOS developers with lightweight 2D rendering capabilities since iOS 2. Its utility knows almost no bounds, as image masking, PDF document creation, parsing, and other similar functions are baked right in making it a no nonsense choice for any sort of drawing task.</p>\n\n<p>For that and many other reasons, if one hits the Googles on how to create an image from something on screen they’ll likely end up with something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">drawSize</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsBeginImageContext</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">drawSize</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">ctx</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">setFillColor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">UIColor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">red</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">cgColor</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">fill</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">CGRect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">y</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">drawSize</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">width</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">drawSize</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">height</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">img</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And it works, so we move on. Though, there are several valid reasons to pump the breaks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>UIGraphicsBegin/EndImageContext are sRGB only (sorry p3 color gamut).</li>\n  <li>It was before the age of blocks, which are common throughout Foundation, UIKit and virtually every framework on iOS.</li>\n  <li>Extensibility is possible, though sometimes a non trivial task.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given its age, it’s not a shocker to say Core Graphics provides an API that’s less than ideal too many of today’s standards. Though Swift’s syntactical sugar prowess has softened the call sites to Core Graphics code over many projects, it still is what it is — a C based API built for simpler times.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code> is built for tomorrow in mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>It’s automagically fully color managed. For example, on the beautiful 9.7 inch iPad pro you’ll get a wide color context.</li>\n  <li>It’s a first class object.</li>\n  <li>It manages its context lifetime, unlocking some memory optimizations on the house from Cupertino &amp; Friends©.</li>\n  <li>The former implicitly means that it caches its context, meaning reuse is an efficient operation as opposed to using new renderers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"gaining-more-cgcontext\">Gaining More (CG)Context</h3>\n\n<p>Initializing and keeping a reference to a renderer is a solid start:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift

id=\"giving-a-renderer-more-cgcontext\">Giving a Renderer More (CG)Context</h3>\n<p>I really need to stop with the (CG)Context bit, but I feel too invested at this point so please just excuse me 🤠.</p>\n\n<p>You have noticed that a graphics renderer will also accept a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</code>object into two of its four available initializers:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">size</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGSize</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">bounds</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGRect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This rendering format has a few options to aid in further specifying the intent of your resulting drawing operations. It also has a useful <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bounds </code>property we’ve been using in the previous code samples that’s derived from its associated graphics context. Using this formatter one can tweak opaque or scale preferences, among other things.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CALayer</code> and its A8 backing store format was introduced in iOS 12 and provides developers with free memory optimizations. If you’re certain, for example, that you’re drawing wide color content <em>using</em> sRGB colors, you can have the renderer optimize for that since the backing store would otherwise be larger to accommodate a larger color range rather than just 0 to 1:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// iOS 10/11</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">prefersExtendedRange</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// iOS 12</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">preferredRange</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">standard</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Turn off iOS 12 optimization</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Many of these decisions will likely be tied to the current trait collection, so it stands to reason that the renderer format can also be fetched on a per trait collection basis as well.</p>\n\n<p>No need to mince in my own words here, Apple’s documentation explains this very well:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Returns a format optimized for the specified trait collection, taking into account properties such as displayScale and displayGamut.</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// Traits that are not specified will be ignored, with their corresponding format properties defaulting to the values in preferredFormat.  </span>\n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">convenience</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"nv\">traitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>No worries if you opt to forgo any of this, as UIKit provides sensible default values for you should you not provide explicit ones. As such, if you do nothing, UIKit gives you the resulting format from its factory method, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">defaultFormat</code> — which provides a format configured for the highest fidelity possible as supported by the device it’s executed on.</p>\n\n<p>Take care to make this choice upfront, however. If you want to configure things, do it at your renderer’s initialization point as the formatter itself holistically represents immutable configurations that it will always use during drawing operations.</p>\n\n<p>All of this hopefully should remind you how extensible and flexible an image renderer can be. For example, hanging a quick extension off of any view to create a circle avatar would be painless and performant (as performant as using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">cornerRadius</code> can really be, that is) since one could reuse the same renderer and its context:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span

This is done via the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UITextInputPasswordRules</code> class:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">createNewPasswordTextField</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITextField</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">newPasswordReqs</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITextInputPasswordRules</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">descriptor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"required: lower; required: digit; max-consecutive: 3; minlength: 12;\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">createNewPasswordTextField</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">passwordRules</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">newPasswordReqs</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Now, when iOS suggests a new password - these rules will be used to generate it</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The pertinent information here is the descriptor parameter, which is a plain string that follows a certain syntax, à la the visual format language:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"s\">\"key: value;\"</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Think of it a dictionary entry that always is followed by semicolon. It’s quite close to CSS declarations. With it, you can specify the following items:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>required : Self explanatory</li>\n  <li>allowed : Allow a subset of allowed characters</li>\n  <li>max-consecutive : Restrict the number of successive characters</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And character classes to match against those rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">upper</code> : A-Z</li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">lower</code> : a-z</li>\n  <li>\n    <table>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">special</code> : -~!@#$%^&amp;*_+=`</td>\n          <td>(){}[:;”’&lt;&gt;,.? ] and space</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  </li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">ascii-printable</code> : All ACII printable</li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">unicode</code> : All unicode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To further things a little, suppose you only wanted to allow the letters “j,o,r,d,a,n” because you want the strongest password that I’ll never, ever most definitely guess, then you could do this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">UITextInputPasswordRules</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">descriptor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"required: [j,o,r,d,a,n]; max-consecutive: 2; minlength: 12;\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Be aware that the framework has some validation against your supplied validation, resulting in some form of validationception.</p>\n\n<p>Your parameters have to <em>at least</em> use two instances of the ASCII uppercase letters, digits and ASDII lowercase letters classes. Other than that, it also must be longer than 12 characters.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t meet this criteria, do you get some sort of runtime error or exception? Nope — the user agent just throws out your insecure, primitive suggestion and uses the default. Which is probably a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, you can do the same thing in HTML by using the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">passwordrules</code> attribute in your input element.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-time-tfa-codes\">One Time TFA Codes</h3>\n\n<p>In one of my favorite “It just works” APIs that Apple supplies to developers, it’s hard to argue that there’s something more trivial to implement in iOS development that simultaneously brings real value to users than setting a text content type.</p>\n\n<p>The powerful heuristics of iOS sucks in passwords and phone numbers, can suggest a relevant address and more. And now, that more is TFA codes, accomplished by doing nothing more than choosing <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">oneTimeCode</code>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">aTFAtextField</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">textContentType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">oneTimeCode</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This also joins the new value, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">newPassword</code>, which would enable the password creation prompts touched on above. The usual restrictions (if you can even call them that) is that the element accepting the password must be a text field, text view or a view that adopts the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UITextInput</code> protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Of note, tvOS apps are also granted the same affordances when using the control center keyboard, the continuity keyboard or even Cupertino’s Remote App. And let’s face it, nobody wants to type on that platform so any shortcuts we can provide just promotes engagement that much more.</p>\n\n<p>Text content type is powerful, but also the definition of lightweight, simple and WYSIWYG. Sometimes what you aren’t is just as important as what you are. That’s also true with framework design.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"graphics-rendering\">Graphics Rendering</h3>\n\n<p>As we’ll briefly discuss later on, iOS 12 has automatic backing store support for views. The depth of their content drives this. So, for example, if you are rendering a grey scale image on the screen iOS will employ an 8 bit per pixel backing store instead of the usual 64 bit per pixel backing store a portrait image would incur.</p>\n\n<p>The cost savings is significant, in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/\">What’s New in Cocoa Touch</a> session, Apple engineer Josh Shaffer notes that the previous example goes from 2.2 megabytes of real estate down to <em>275 kilobytes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As aforementioned, views get this out of the box. If you draw into offscreen bitmaps using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code>, though, iOS won’t be able to predict the developer’s intentions with the resulting image. As such, a configurable buffer backing store style has been introduced so one can take part in the memory savings:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">rendererFormat</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">default</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">rendererFormat</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">preferredRange</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">extended</span> <span class=\"c1\">// For an extended range image</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">renderer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">size</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">rendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Above, we indicated our intention to utilize an extended range image. Though, we can also indicate that its unspecified, automatic or standard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-small-quick-win\">The Small Quick Win</h3>\n\n<p>Detecting user interface orientations is traditionally frowned upon via Apple’s official stance. And though trait collections offer us most of what we need, it’s still refreshing to see Apple come full circle on all the edge cases with two new additions here:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">device</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIDevice</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">current</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">isFlat</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">device</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">orientation</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isFlat</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">isValid</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">device</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">orientation</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isValidInterfaceOrientation</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"darkness-for-days\">Darkness for Days</h3>\n\n<p>Also, we have dark mode on iOS, finally! Mojave doesn’t get all the fun!</p>\n\n<p>Err…shoot, no wait — we just have API support for it. But it doesn’t officially exist. But it also kinda does too, because the code is there. It’s shipped with Xcode.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know. I’m just telling you that trait collections now know about it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">darkTraitCollection</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">userInterfaceStyle</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dark</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>…there’s obviously enumerations for it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">@available(iOS 12.0, *)</span> <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">enum</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIUserInterfaceStyle</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Int</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">unspecified</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">light</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">dark</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>…but they only apply to CarPlay on iOS 12 beta 1.</p>\n\n<p>So there you go 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notifications\">Notifications</h3>\n\n<p>Technically not part of UIKit, but I did have to highlight one welcome change aside from the new grouping capabilities. Look, dealing with notifications is often a pain from a developer perspective. While not a forgone conclusion, the more notification offerings we have to support, generally the issues that could arise grow exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>You have the system notification view to toggle app permissions within iOS’ settings, possibly your own user interface to allow for granular choices, APNS to go through and oh, let’s not forget the network to contend with too.</p>\n\n<p>So, the fact that you can deep link directly into your app’s notification settings from an incoming one is not a small improvement (via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">providesAppNotificationSettings</code>), but a very welcome change as developers continue their journey towards simplifying notification issues for them, the end user and customer support.</p>\n\n<p>🕺!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"-and-the-free-ones-\">… And The Free Ones 🙌</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1003831980025372673\">iOS 12 is fast</a>. A lot of the improvements we’ll enjoy come from deep within the framework itself. Here, I’ve chosen to highlight API changes you’ll need to put some time into to reap benefits.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s the thing — our apps will feel a bit smoother, faster and coherent without us having done anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons why range from smarter cell prefetching via the API scheduling things serially, smarter CPU diversification, more intelligent backing stores for <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIView</code> and Auto Layout (quite impressively) hitting O(n) instead of O(n²) for multiple common layout scenarios, to name a few.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n\n<p>Personally, I came away more impressed than I thought I would be with iOS 12. Initially, it appeared that a lot of the chatter preemptively declared that iOS 12 would be a day late and dollar short. Last year, we were treated to some marquee features within UIKit like drag and drop — so what could they throw down for us this year?</p>\n\n<p>But, as is typical, W.W.D.C. brought some new stuff we weren’t expecting, hardening updates and most importantly the new APIs. Exciting times, plus — our apps are just better by virtue of simply running on the new OS. UIKit will always be at the forefront, and this year was no exception as there’s still plenty of discussions left to be had around this year’s improvements.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When Swift hit, we were enamored over its simplicity compared to Objective-C. Then it quickly became key to roll with protocol oriented programming. Also, forget reference types and classes. The list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>And true — those things are great tools and have superb use cases. But I sense they are often lifted up as silver bullets without the necessary amount of thought that should probably be given to architectural decisions.</p>\n\n<p>So in 2018, the blog posts overfloweth with Swift hackery (even on my blog 🤷🏻‍♂️) and the conference talks wax poetic of its future using functional programming parlance (yup, I’ve done that too 🙋🏻‍♂️).</p>\n\n<p>Everyone seems excited about working with collections in Swift <strong>but</strong> we’ve also been able to do <em>similar</em> things in Objective-C since iOS 3. So today, I’m chatting about the power of NSPredicate and how you can sift through collections with it using the 🦖.</p>\n\n<p>I think it’s relevant to bring it back up, as now we’re seeing developers at this point who’ve started with Swift, and then later have circled back to maintain some Objective-C. If that’s you, it’s possible that you’ve been frustrated with the amount of boilerplate or iteration you’ve had to write when using collections in Objective-C.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I have might have something for you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-use-case\">The Use Case</h3>\n\n<p>We’ve come a long way in recent years when it comes to Objective-C collections. Not more than a handful of years ago, we had to tell the compiler we were much smarter than it was:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">aString</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)[</span><span class=\"n\">anArray</span> <span class=\"nv\">indexOfObject</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Thanks Heavens, Cupertino and Friends© eventually tacked on generics by way of type erasure. This marked a significant improvement:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">anArray</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"err\">@</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">@\"Sup\"</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">aString</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">anArray</span> <span class=\"n\">firstObject</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>But generics or not, we often interact with the contents of Objective-C collections by doing something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">anArray</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">str</span> <span class=\"nv\">isEqualToString</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">@\"The Key\"</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>   \n    <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n        <span class=\"c1\">// Do something  </span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>A lot of times, that’s kosher. But as the requirements become more complex and the relationships more varied, the code gets a bit iffy. If you subscribe to the notion that less code means less bugs and better maintenance, the simple act of querying collections can become a bother.</p>\n\n<p>Predicates can lessen the blow here. It’s not about being “tricky” or cute with our code, but pragmatic and succinct.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-10000-foot-view\">The 10,000 Foot View</h3>\n\n<p>At its core, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSPredicate</code> is used to constrain or define the parameters for in memory filtering or when performing a fetch. It really got its bones when paired with Core Data. It’s like SQL, except less awful*.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I joke, it’s just that set based operations have never made sense to me 🙃.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You supply it logical conditions, and it helps to return things that match said conditions. This means it provides support for basic comparisons, compound predicates, key path collections queries, subqueries, aggregates and more.</p>\n\n<p>As it’s used to sift through collections, you can expect Foundation classes to support it out of the box. Mutable varieties support in-place mutations from the results, whereas their immutable flavors will return a new instance:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// In place  </span>\n<span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">mutableArray</span> <span class=\"nv\">filterUsingPredicate</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"cm\">/*NSPredicate*/</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// New instance returned  </span>\n<span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">mutableArray</span> <span class=\"nv\">filteredArrayUsingPredicate</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"cm\">/*NSPredicate*/</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Though predicates can be instantiated from <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate?language=objc\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSExpression</code></a> , <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate?language=objc\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSCompoundPredicate</code></a> or <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nspredicate?language=objc\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSComparisonPredicate</code></a> — it can also be created using a string syntax. This is similar to the Visual Format Language that one can use to define layout constraints.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll be focusing on the utility of using the string syntax method.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-setup\">The Setup</h3>\n\n<p>To illustrate, let’s consider the following code for the remainder of the post:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Pseudo code   </span>\n<span class=\"kt\">Person</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSObject</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">Identifier</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">Name</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">PayGrade</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSNumber</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// An some property somewhere containing Person instances  </span>\n<span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">employees</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"query-time-️\">Query Time ⚡️</h3>\n\n<p>What follows for the rest of the post are straight forward examples of how to setup queries using the string format syntax.</p>\n\n<p>We can start with a simple search scenario. Let’s assume we’ve got an array containing identifiers representing Person objects:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"s\">@\"erersdg32453tr\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>  \n    <span class=\"s\">@\"dfs8rw093jrkls\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>  \n    <span class=\"c1\">// etc  </span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Now, we’d like to retrieve Person objects from an existing array of Person objects from these identifiers. Using a double nested for-loop, it could be accomplished as such:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Assume \"employees\" is an existing array of Person objects</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">morningEventAttendees</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"err\">@</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"cm\">/*Identifiers of people listed above*/</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">peopleAttendingMorningEvent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">userID</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">morningEventAttendees</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">Person</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">person</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">employees</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n    <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">person</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">identifier</span> <span class=\"nv\">isEqualToString</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">userID</span><span class=\"p\">])</span>  \n        <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n            <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">peopleAttending</span> <span class=\"nv\">addObject</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">person</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>  \n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Now peopleAttendingMorningEvent has what we want</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The exact same result is accomplished using a predicate as such:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSPredicate</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">morningAttendees</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSPredicate</span> <span class=\"nv\">predicateWithFormat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">@\"SELF.identifier IN %@\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">peopleAttendingMorningEvent</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">peopleAttendingMorningEvent</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">employees</span> <span class=\"nv\">filteredArrayUsingPredicate</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">morningAttendees</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>💫.</p>\n\n<p>Predicate syntax allows for the use of SELF, which is used to great effect here. It represents the object contained within the array being operated on, so for us — Person objects.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another bonus is that we’ve dropped the mutability of the array definition._</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s for this reason we can access the key paths associated with the object that SELF is representing. You’re seeing that above, as the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">identifier</code> property is referenced.</p>\n\n<p>Should you prefer, any key path can also be expressed via a variable using the “%K” syntax in its place. This version does the same as above:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSPredicate</span> <span class=\"nv\">predicateWithFormat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">@\"SELF.%K IN %@\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"identifier\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">peopleAttendingMorningEvent</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"compound-predicates\">Compound Predicates</h3>\n\n<p>It’s trivial to combine comparisons. Suppose our requirements now call for finding users attending events the same way as above, but now their paygrade must also be between 50,000 and 60,000.</p>\n\n<p>If traditional approaches win out, then our first if statement will only grow:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Same code as above same for this tweak  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">([</span><span class=\"n\">person</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">identifier</span> <span class=\"nv\">isEqualToString</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">userID</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">person</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">paygrade</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">integerValue</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span> <span class=\"mi\">5</span> <span class=\"o\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"n\">person</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">paygrade</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">integerValue</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">peopleAttending</span> <span class=\"nv\">addObject</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">person</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>But using a refactored predicate gets us there in a more idiomatic way:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSPredicate</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">morningAttendees</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSPredicate</span> <span class=\"nv\">predicateWithFormat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">@\"SELF.identifier IN %@ &amp;&amp; SELF.paygrade.integerValue BETWEEN {50000, 60000}\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">peopleAttendingMorningEvent</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The syntax allows for different operators denoting the same thing which can help hone in on readability, per your preference. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“&amp;&amp;” or “AND”</li>\n  <li>\n    <table>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>”</td>\n          <td> </td>\n          <td>” or “OR”</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  </li>\n  <li>”!” or “NOT”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As expected, these are usually aggregated into one predicate by using them in tandem with the basic comparison operators you are likely expecting:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"string-comparisons\">String Comparisons</h3>\n\n<p>We’re often tasked with matching values based off of string comparisons. It’s well known that Objective-C shines its unrequited love for verboseness in no greater light than when dealing with NSString:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"Jordan\"</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"nv\">stringByAppendingString</span><span class=\"p\">:[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSString</span> <span class=\"nv\">stringWithFormat</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">@\"%@ %@\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"Wesley\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"Morgan\"</span><span class=\"p\">]]</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>…whereas Swift just smirks and concatenates its own strings with much less fuss.

            "content_html": "<p>It’s astounding to think that we lived in a pre Auto Layout world not that long ago. Auto resizing masks and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CGRectMake()</code> ruled the lands of user interface development for quite some time.</p>\n\n<p>But as Apple’s devices started stacking up various point sizes, it was obvious that developers would either languish in the pit of misery that can result from too many frame calculations or embrace the power of describing relationships. The latter, obviously, won out.</p>\n\n<p>And thus, Auto Layout has been <a href=\"https://oleb.net/blog/2014/03/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-auto-layout/\">used</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/SnapKit/Masonry\">DSL</a>‘d and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/4t6kd5/why_i_dont_use_autolayout/\">criticized</a> ever since. With its rise, though, another layout paradigm also came into prominence. The “spacer” view. Or dummy view. Container view.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever you call it, we’ve all used them. But Apple, as so it often does, says there is a better way. This week, let’s chat <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UILayoutGuide</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"but-dummy-views-rock-and-i-agree\">But Dummy Views Rock (…and I agree)</h3>\n\n<p>Dummy views solve some layout problems extremely well. That’s why we all use(d) them. Expressing inter-view relationships, creating modular chunks of your user interface or defining constraints to express the coordinates or size of empty spaces between views all called for the dummy view.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if one simply wished to center a group of controls in a particular coordinate space, a dummy view was often used to contain them.</p>\n\n<p>As such, a lot of important jobs were all entrusted to a construct that was never meant to truly do any of them. If you contest that notion, ask yourself what a view actually does in an iOS application.</p>\n\n<p>Or better yet, let the docs tell the story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A view object renders content within its bounds rectangle and handles any interactions with that content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A view is a subclass of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIResponder</code> and can respond to touches and other types of events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it’s hardly disputible to reason that an important part of a view being a view is to render stuff and handle events. Dummy views, views though they are — shouldn’t particpate in any of those activities at best and <em>do</em> participate in some of them at worst.</p>\n\n<p>Using dummy views, we’ve</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Incurred the cost of a view that’s only helping to define a layout.</li>\n  <li>Added a first class member of the view hierarchy, joining in on all the overhead that may be associated with any task related to it.</li>\n  <li>And as part of the responder chain, it could intercept some messages that it was never intended to handle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>😬.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"there-but-not-really\">There, but Not Really</h3>\n\n<p>But a layout guide is none of those things, nor does it suffer from any of those problems. It’s a non-rendering view, much like its more powerful cousin, <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/UIStackView-a-Field-Guide\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIStackView</code></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike a bonafide view, a layout guide actually doesn’t define a view. Instead, it just represents a retangular region in their owning view’s coordinate system. That’s it. This is what allows it to interact with Auto Layout.</p>\n\n<p>The API closely, and purposely, mirrors that of a view:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div

There are times when one must mix both a frame based approach and Auto Layout within the same view hierarchy and this can help immensely.</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">CGRect</span> <span class=\"n\">guideRect</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">someLayoutGuide</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">layoutFrame</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">aNonAutoLayoutView</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">frame</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGRectMake</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">guideRect</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">size</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">height</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Remember here though, because the layout frame is derived from Auto Layout, you’ll need to ensure the constraints have been installed before this property is of any use to you. By the time the layout guide’s owning view has called <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">layoutSubviews</code> — this will have the expected results.</p>\n\n<p>Further, if you need to continue down the layout debugging path you may find the following two components are what you need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">constraintsAffectingLayout:for:)</code> function</li>\n  <li>And the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">hasAmbigiousLayout</code> property</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Using the function above, you can see all the constraints for a given axis (i.e. vertical or horizontal). Use it to see if there are any unexpected constraints influencing it:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">constraintsEffectingVertical</span><span class=\"p\">:[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSLayoutConstraint</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bottomLeftGuide</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">constraintsAffectingLayout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">for</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">horizontal</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Lastly, the boolean property acts exactly how it’s named. It’s utility lies in the fact that you can easily check for ambigious constraints on _just _the layout guide using a symbolic breakpoint. If you are like me, sometimes you want the show to come to a total halt if something like this happens. I sometimes wrap this in an <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSAssert()</code> in my own side projects so I have to deal with the issue right away.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n\n<p>If brevity is the source of wit, then the layout guide may be the sharpest of them all nesteled inside UIKit. It’s insanely simple — just a plain old thing that looks like a view, smells like a view, acts like a view and….isn’t a view. It’s just a rectangular region that loves Auto Layout.</p>\n\n<p>And in so many cases, that’s all a developer needs. So next time you feel yourself reaching for a spacer view, opt to embrace the simplicity and safety of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UILayoutGuide</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Developing for the web feels like a world that’s simply left me behind. I made a concerted effort to double down on iOS development several years ago. I’ve never looked back or regretted it, and I don’t even know what the rear view mirror looks like. It’s caked in dust by this point, no doubt.</p>\n\n<p>Though I’ve <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/swift-javascript\">mentioned web related things here before</a>, the last time I did any meaningful web development in a professional context, I was using JQuery v4.x.</p>\n\n<p>So, yeah — it’s been a few years and (seemingly) several thousand Javascript frameworks later. I don’t venture into that ecosystem much, and my last trips were on account of the things I’m about to mention here.</p>\n\n<p>Which is, there are some incredibly trivial things one can do on their website to couple it to their iOS app counterpart. If you have the next thirty minutes free, I’d wager you could do all of them listed here.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s rock 🤘</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"give-your-saas-some-sass\">Give your SaaS some sass</h3>\n\n<p>First, what’s the end game here? To simply leverage some hosted .json files on your server and put meta tags in your markup to allow users to jump straight into your app or display information about it more effectively. That’s it.</p>\n\n<p>This stuff is typically key for SaaS business’ or solopreneurs because in the world we live in, where there is a SaaS website a (hopefully) native app will follow. We want to help them dance together.</p>\n\n<p>It helps that iOS 11 built features specifically for this. Open up your camera, point it at a QR code. Boom — iOS shows us the actionable details. Share a link in messages. Get a rich text preview. The list goes on.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"qr-code-detection\">QR Code Detection</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s start with everyone’s favorite technology, quick response codes.</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">//TODO: (insert QR code joke here)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Creating a QR code that users can point to and then be prompted to download, open or route to a part of your app can be useful. Doing so can be accomplished by setting up an <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">apple-app-site-association</code> JSON file with an “applinks” key value pair and hosting it. You may already have this file for hand off support.</p>\n\n<p>For this purpose, it looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"applinks\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"apps\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[],</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"details\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"appID\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"DJGHSDJGH24.com.blogPost.yolo\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"*\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The appID key simply must be your team or app ID,(.), followed by your bundle ID.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An easy place for the JSON file to live is typically in the .well-known subdirectory:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"err\">https</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"err\">//wwww.anExample.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Additionally, planting it at the root of your server works just fine too.</p>\n\n<p>If you host such a file, the end result is that your app will immediately show to open via a notification when the user points at the QR code. The only metadata your QR code needs is the URL for your website.</p>\n\n<p>No external QR code download, no more taps — nothing. It just happens.</p>\n\n<p>If the user doesn’t have your app, Safari will kick in instead, taking them to your website.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"getting-particular\">Getting Particular</h3>\n\n<p>You have the ability to specify a few things within your applinks key-value pairs. Let’s look at what’s available:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>apps</strong> — You supply an empty array here. I would tell you why, but I would be making it up because Apple literally says nothing else about it besides that so…¯(°_o)/¯</li>\n  <li><strong>details</strong> — An array of dictionaries, one for each app that your site ultimately supports. Ordering matters in the array, as iOS look up links according to it. This allows you to specify an app to handle a certain part of your website.</li>\n  <li><strong>details[appid]</strong> — The team ID or app ID with a period, and your app’s bundle ID tacked on.</li>\n  <li><strong>details[paths] </strong>— An array or strings that determine which parts of your website are supported by the app. Additionally, you can say which parts **aren’t **supported.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first three entries don’t merit much more discussion. The paths entry does have some nifty options for excluding content where applicable.</p>\n\n<p>For example, including “NOT “ at the beginning of the path will basically blacklist that content from being used as a universal link:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"applinks\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"apps\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[],</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"details\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"appID\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"DJGHSDJGH24.com.blogPost.yolo\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/posts/iOS\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"NOT /oldPosts/outdated/*\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>This works much like regex, with support for wildcards:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"applinks\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"apps\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[],</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"details\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"appID\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"DJGHSDJGH24.com.blogPost.yolo\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/posts/iOS\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n                </span><span class=\"s2\">\"/oldPosts/201?/*\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>A few random words of advice:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Keep in mind these matches are case sensitive.</li>\n  <li>If you’re rocking a few domains, you’ll need to roll an <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">apple-app-site-association</code> file for each one that your app supports. Example: apple.com would have different motives than someProducts.apple.com</li>\n  <li>One doesn’t actually need to appended “.json” to the JSON file. Don’t ask me how I know this, or how much hypothetical time was lost to it.</li>\n  <li>If you associate several apps within one <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">apple-app-site-association</code> file, iOS will handle it by presenting an alert showing each one to determine which is opened. The next time this happens, iOS will suggest the last choice as a default — but users can still switch this via a force touch or by pulling down on the notification.</li>\n  <li>Safari handles all of this as well. If you hosted the QR code as an image, and an iOS user 3D touches on it — this exact same flows happens.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"associated-domains\">Associated Domains</h3>\n\n<p>As an iOS developer, you’ve got some duties too. Chief among them is to let Xcode know you’re expecting this to happen. This is done by the “Associated Domains” capability for your app binary.</p>\n\n<p>Flip it on within Xcode and add some entries for each one you wish to support. Again, you might’ve spent time here already if you’ve developed for hand off capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>For this particular type of routing, though, it would look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"err\">//</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">i.e.</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">applinks</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\">  \n</span><span class=\"err\">applinks</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"err\">anExample.com</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>As we’ll see later, this creates a handshake of sorts that confirms both the app and website trust one another. Xcode will generate an entitlement to reconcile the security aspect and apply it on your app’s behalf. Spoiler alert, this opens up the door for quick credential retrieval too, as we’ll see later.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this means you’ll need to handle the user activity passed to you within your app delegate. But, that’s a blog post for another day.</p>\n\n<p>Using universal app links is great, and I hope more apps use it as time goes on. They can happen outside of a QR code context too. They enjoy certain advantages over custom URL schemes in that they are more secure due to the handshake, they can’t be hijacked or claimed by any other app and the only party who can associate one to your app, is you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"web-credentials\">Web Credentials</h3>\n\n<p>This nifty trick is absolutely essential for you if your app has a log in mechanism or any user portal system online. By employing password autofill, users can tap on the lock icon in the quicktype bar that appears over the keyboard, authenticate and then have their information automatically filled out.</p>\n\n<p>It’s beautiful, and I use it daily.</p>\n\n<p>To allow for this to happen, there is minor housekeeping that you need to do for the text fields or text views representing your log in. Simply assign the correct values added in iOS 11 to their textContentType property so iOS knows what goes where:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"err\">loginField.textContentType</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">.username</span><span class=\"w\">  \n</span><span class=\"err\">passwordField.textContentType</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">.password</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>That’s all it takes from a coding standpoint — nothing more than assigning to a property (if you don’t, you leave it up to iOS’ heuristics to make the assumptions). There’s nothing left other than to respond accordingly to the incoming “did change” delegate methods or notifications that’ll be fired off with the credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, you could stop here and things would work….<em>ish</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Users would just get the quick type bar, but your site’s credentials wouldn’t be offered up within it. They’d just see the lock icon, then have to auth up, search for it and select it.</p>\n\n<p>Amateur hour. Obviously, we’d prefer the user’s credentials to show up immediately once either one of those text controls becomes first responder.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"establishing-trust-again\">Establishing Trust, Again</h3>\n\n<p>Which brings us back to our <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">apple-app-site-association</code> file.</p>\n\n<p>Going deeper into the same thought above, a signed entitlement tells iOS which sites you are associated with. The secure, two way link is established in particular when your app is installed or updated. At that point iOS does a wellness check by traversing your domains listed within your Associated Domains (which we mentioned above) and pings each one to see if it gets a valid association file.</p>\n\n<p>If the app points to the website and the website points to the app — we’re cooking.</p>\n\n<p>The entry under Associated Domains for password autofill looks a bit different than the above app links we entered before, as it’s prefixed with “webcredentials”:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"err\">webcredentials</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"err\">anExample.com</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>XCode gonna’ Xcode. If you’re still seeing an error at this point, you might need to hop over to the developer portal and enable Associated Domains for your app ID.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you’ve likely keyed in on, the Associated Domains entries follow the same pattern of including a service (i.e. activitycontinuation, applinks, etc) and domain:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"err\">&lt;service&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"err\">&lt;fully</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">qualified</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">domain&gt;</span><span class=\"p\">[:</span><span class=\"err\">port</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">number</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>From there, it’s a case of adding that to your association file:</p>\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"applinks\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"apps\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[],</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"details\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"s2\">\"appID\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"DJGHSDJGH24.com.blogPost.yolo\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"s2\">\"paths\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"/posts/iOS\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">  \n            </span><span class=\"s2\">\"/oldPosts/201?/*\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"p\">},</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"webcredentials\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">  \n        </span><span class=\"s2\">\"apps\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">\"DJGHSDJGH24.com.blogPost.yolo\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"w\">  \n    </span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">  \n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The only key to worry about is “apps”, which is just an array of strings (their value constructed the same way as above with app links) that represent the apps your site provides log in information for.</p>\n\n<p>Once you throw that up on your site — the entire web credentials and password autofill pipeline is all set. I can’t tell you how much times this saves from a user perspective. It goes up by an order of magnitude if one uses Safari’s password suggestions as well.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"image-links\">Image Links</h3>\n\n<p>Sharing links within Messages is a ubiquitous practice among iOS users. Nothing is more rewarding than tapping on the link cards, with their inviting .png hero images sitting there beckoning us to load up a website within Safari.</p>\n\n<p>Except when that doesn’t happen, and it’s just plain text 😬.</p>\n\n<p>This is so easy to avoid, though, as you easily can control the title, icon, image and even video that displays.

            "content_html": "<p>Measuring units, things or items in software won’t always be the most glamorous job for software engineers. Though not as thrilling as writing performant user interface libraries nor as fulfilling as conjuring up networking code that weaves concurrent execution with ease, measuring units in iOS is still done more often than not, wrong.</p>\n\n<p>How can one author such code in an internationlized manner and not in a precipitous one? Foundation, as is so often the case, holds the answer. And it has since iOS 10.</p>\n\n<p>This week, let’s look at NSMeasurement and friends.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"more-common-than-you-think\">More Common than You Think</h3>\n\n<p>Software has always had situations that crop up which present users with several things that are either measurable or generally quanitifiable. And when that software (iOS) runs on billions of devices across the globe, the need to represent internationalized values of those things becomes not only more important, but quite key.</p>\n\n<p>Getting such measurements and units right isn’t a baseline experience, you should just expect it of your software.</p>\n\n<p>So with that- these APIs aid not only just with the obvious “converter” apps, but also with games, shopping lists and everything else in between:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Are you representing a measurement of time ⌚️?</li>\n  <li>A distance traveled 🚙?</li>\n  <li>The rate at which we traveled 🗺?</li>\n  <li>The weight of an object ⚖️?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As such, the temptation to use a simple double type makes sense on the surface level and simply breaks apart anywhere else:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">//Technically we even set up the variable name for failure  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">milesTraveled</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Double</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"nsmeasurement-and-all-his-units\">NSMeasurement and all his Units</h3>\n\n<p>Following the previous example, what we really need is an accurate, bonafide construct to represent a measurement. And while miles is certainly a measurement, it’s only one that generally makes sense within the context of Murica’ 🇺🇸. As such, Foundation’s support for a measurement is tactfully generic:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span> \n</code></pre></div></div>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Note that within the text, for stylistic purposes and because I code in Objective-C daily, I’ll refer to the frameworks with their NS prefix. All of these objects are properly bridged over to Swift as value types and structs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It provides a way to provide a generic <em>unit</em> of measurement and also a value that corresponds to it. Its initializer will ask for both:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Double</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">UnitType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Every unit will always have a symbol, though not every unit has a dimension nor will they always be equivalent to one another. It’s something to note, sure, but one will most likely work with dimensional units. But, it’s for this reason that NSUnit’s designated initializer will require only a symbol:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"kt\">Unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSObject</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSCopying</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">symbol</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">String</span>  \n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">symbol</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">String</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>When it comes to NSMeasurement, this unit type drives the majority of the work, and you can define which to use via its initializer, but more commonly you’ll use an NSDimension (which subclasses NSUnit) provided to us by Apple. Each dimensional unit will then drive down further into a given dimension that exists within the unit.</p>\n\n<p>For example, say we wanted to measure time. Our unit would be duration, but we’ve got several ways to represent duration such as the second, minute and hour:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">abstractValue</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">1.0</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 1 second  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">seconds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">abstractValue</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitDuration</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">seconds</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 1 minute  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">minutes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">abstractValue</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitDuration</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">minutes</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 1 hour  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">hours</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">abstractValue</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitDuration</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">hours</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Foundation includes a truckload of dimensional units, everything from electrical currents to pressure. Though you are free to subclass and create your own units, in fact — there is quite robust support for that, I’m not sure you’ll ever need to.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some common dimensional units baked in for free:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>UnitLength : Base Unit is meters (m)</li>\n  <li>UnitMass : Base unit is kilograms (kg)</li>\n  <li>UnitDuration : Base unit is seconds (sec)</li>\n  <li>UnitArea : Base unit is square meters (m²)</li>\n  <li>UnitAcceleration : Base unit is meters per second squared (m/s²)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are about 170 dimensional unit types and it’s likely Foundation has thought of your use case.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"operating-on-measurements\">Operating on Measurements</h3>\n\n<p>Working with measurements is trivial due to the fact that they conform to equatable out of the box, so comparisons are carried out uniformly:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">abstractValue</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">1.0</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">seconds</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">abstractValue</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitDuration</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">seconds</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">minutes</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">abstractValue</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitDuration</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">minutes</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 61.0 seconds, measured in the dimension's base unit  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">totalTime</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">seconds</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">minutes</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 30.5 seconds  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">halfTheTime</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">totalTime</span><span class=\"o\">/</span><span class=\"mi\">2</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The entire measurement API does all of the heavy lifting for you. This is true when you operate on units of the same dimension but in different forms.

For most cases, that’s going to be units that adhere to a linear equation or a scale factor. As such, UnitConverterLinear will be supplied:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">imperialLength</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">5280.0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitLength</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">feet</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">metricLength</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Measurement</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">value</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">0.62</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">unit</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitLength</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">kilometers</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 2229.344 meters  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">totalLength</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">imperialLength</span> <span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">metricLength</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// 1.385 miles  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">justMiles</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">totalLength</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">converted</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">to</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UnitLength</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">miles</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Don’t worry about creating conversions that don’t relate to one another.

Be sure to glance over its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/measurementformatter\">documentation</a>.

Part of the magic of utilizing Foundation’s measurement and unit APIs is that they are locale aware. If you’re currently changing the location within the iOS simualtor to see how things shake out, there is another way you might prefer.</p>\n\n<p>Just dupe your scheme, and pick the desired locale:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Edit Scheme</li>\n  <li>Hit “Duplicate Scheme”, it’s in the bottom left in Xcode 9</li>\n  <li>Name it</li>\n  <li>Under Run -&gt; Options -&gt; Application Region, then choose the region to test with</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is nice, because it’s a no fuss and deliberate approach.

And the best optimizations are the ones I don’t even have to make. They just happen.</p>\n\n<p>With copy on write semantics for Foundation collections, this week’s topic, that’s exactly what we get.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cow-primer\">C.o.W Primer</h3>\n\n<p>Both the amatuear and the veteran programmer know that we don’t go far without embracing collections, yet by and large there isn’t much thought or questioning that occurs as to what their doing behind the scenes or how exactly they work beyond our CompSci 101 course.</p>\n\n<p>It can sometimes serve as intimidating subject matter, but luckily copy on write is both a simple concept and, as such, is easy to conceptualize. The elevator pitch is that instances pointing to the same object shouldn’t need to employ full copies unless one of them, does in fact, mutate:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">ar1</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"err\">@</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">@\"TTIDG\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"s\">@\"Pizza\"</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"n\">mutableCopy</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">ar2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ar1</span> <span class=\"n\">mutableCopy</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Here, both variables hold the same data. So why create a full copy unless it’s actually needed? This means that instead of creating the full copy, we can just utilize pointers to the same backing store and enjoy a much more efficient O(1) operation.</p>\n\n<p>All we’re talking about here is an optimization strategy. Even better, the whole technique is all in the name. We shouldn’t copy data unless it’s written to, in which case — we have a reason to carry forward the actual copy. Copy on write.</p>\n\n<p>So, TL;DR — copies are super cheap now. In fact, they are almost downright free for defensive copying code. In the past, they were typically linear at best.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"foundation-implications\">Foundation Implications</h3>\n\n<p>This means that our good friends NSSet, NSDictionary and NSArray will all benefit from the optimization made by the folks maintaining the Foundation Framework. Going back to our previous example:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">ar1</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"err\">@</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">@\"TTIDG\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"s\">@\"Pizza\"</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">ar2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ar1</span> <span class=\"n\">mutableCopy</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Currently, both arrays point to the same backing store</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Now a mutation occurred, with CoW - this is where the copy actually takes place  </span>\n<span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">ar1</span> <span class=\"n\">removeLastItem</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>A large number of application flows might not ever reach a mutated state, thus the copy operation was effectively wasted effort. If it doesn’t occur, the only hit we’ll take with CoW is the allocation of the second collection — which likely won’t be much.</p>\n\n<p>But — be mindful of what it isn’t:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">ar1</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"err\">@</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">@\"TTIDG\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"s\">@\"Pizza\"</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">ar2</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">ar1</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>This isn’t the same at all, and copy on write doesn’t apply. Here we’re pointing to the exact same reference in memory. Remember that this particular optimization is all about efficient copies. Even though pointing to a reference and copying data deals with sharing said data, they are much different in implentation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"applications\">Applications</h3>\n\n<p>Even though copy on write is a performance optimization, it shouldn’t soley be thought as one in pragmatic terms. It’s great that it’s there, we’ll benefit from it without having lifted a finger — but how we can leverage it to do things we maybe couldn’t before?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/244/\">Session 244 at WWDC 17</a> offered a few great examples. Suppose we have an array property:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">@property</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">strong</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">foo</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The intention of the declaration implies that it shouldn’t have mutable state. But hey — life comes at you fast:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Trolling  </span>\n<span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">foo</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Now, consider this:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">@property</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">copy</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">copiedArray</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>  \n<span class=\"kd\">@property</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">strong</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">stongArray</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">copiedArray</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">strongArray</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Logs out 'No'  </span>\n<span class=\"kt\">NSLog</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">@\"%@\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">copiedArray</span> <span class=\"nv\">isKindOfClass</span><span class=\"p\">:[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"kd\">class</span><span class=\"p\">]]</span> <span class=\"p\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"Yes\"</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"No\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Logs out 'Yes'  </span>\n<span class=\"kt\">NSLog</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">@\"%@\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">strongArray</span> <span class=\"nv\">isKindOfClass</span><span class=\"p\">:[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"kd\">class</span><span class=\"p\">]]</span> <span class=\"p\">?</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"Yes\"</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">@\"No\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The copy attribute has been around since the beginning — and it’s commonly put to great use with class clusters. What’s happening here is that sending a copy message to something that is mutable (i.e. the NSMutableArray here) will still return an immutable copy. Copy on write makes life even faster in such a scenario.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing on with Objective-Cisms — mutable collections are often used to build something up. This is a common technique found within many functions, where the author will then declare the return type as immutable. Yet, since a mutable array is a kind of array, this is perfectly legal:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"n\">allEmployees</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">container</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">//build up container with employees...  </span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">//i.e. [container addObject:anEmployee]</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">container</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>And innocently enough, we’ve sharing mutable state again. The method header deceives any caller now, the 🍰 is a lie.</p>\n\n<p>Since we’ve got copy on write, we don’t even need to bother with such a qundary since copies are cheap. We can do the right thing and sleep easy on performance hits:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSArray</span>  <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"n\">allEmployees</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"n\">container</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">NSMutableArray</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">//build up container with employees...  </span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">//i.e. [container addObject:anEmployee]</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">container</span> <span class=\"n\">copy</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Also — Swift 👋?</p>\n\n<p>Think about the bridging process. If you, or perhaps another framework, have a foundation collection returned to you that one has to use in Swift code — you’re getting the value type of the collection since the language employs value type semantics.</p>\n\n<p>How does one enforce that 🤔?</p>\n\n<p>…with a copy on the reference type during the bridging process. So now if that bridged data was never mutated, the whole bridging operation’s efficiency is greatly improved. Which, I suppose, is a nice seque to wrap things up.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n\n<p>As I positied in one of <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/objective-c-in-2015\">my more popular articles a few years ago</a>, Objective-C has become stronger and more capable due to Swift’s presence alone. The sea of apps using Objective-C runs deep, and now their collections run faster. It’s not surprising, as copy on write semantics have been with Swift developers since the beginning.</p>\n\n<p>And now, here we are, with Objective-C getting in on the fun now. #DinosaurNotDead, am I right?</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",
