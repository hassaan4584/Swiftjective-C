### About Me
Swiftjective-C is written by me, [Jordan Morgan](https://www.twitter.com/jordanmorgan10){:target="_blank"}. I'm an iOS engineer from Ozark, Missouri where I live with my [wife](https://www.instagram.com/jmorgan){:target="_blank"} and three kids. Currently, I work remotely on the iOS team at [Buffer](https://www.buffer.com){:target="_blank"}, where we build a suite of social media tools. 

As an indie, I design and develop [Spend Stack]({{ site.spendStackURL }}), a list app built off of CloudKit that can keep an accurate running total of its items.

### Site History
This journal originally started on Medium in 2015 and was called "[The Traveled iOS Developer's Guide](https://medium.com/the-traveled-ios-developers-guide){:target="_blank"}". I enjoyed several years writing there, and to the best of my knowledge, I was lucky enough to grow it into one of the largest iOS blogs on the platform with around 13,000 subscribers when I had left.

I eventually opted to move things over here for a few reasons:

- I wanted to change the name to something much shorter than "The Traveled iOS Developer's Guide".
- I wanted to host and truly own my own content.
- And I wanted to dip back into some web development.

In terms of my motivation to write about iOS development and create a dedicated space for it:

- I have a natural love of writing, and doing so scratches an itch that's otherwise left untouched. 
- Sharing knowledge, what I know and what I hope to learn is also built into my ethos. It's rewarding, I get to meet other developers and hopefully it's helpful. 
- And now with three kids - I've found it extremely challenging to attend or speak at conferences anymore. I'm naturally extroverted so I miss this; Swiftjective-C acts as a creative outlet to participate in the conversation at large that's always happening in our industry.

Tonally, I opt for much more of an "open journal" style of writing. My hope is that each post feels more like you and I having a conversation that it does reading a tutorial on how to do X or Y.

In addition to my technical articles, in January of 2019 I started a series, "The Indie Dev Diaries", which explores the human side of indie development. These are open letters to myself dealing with every component of creating your own iOS app as an indie; the business side, the questions, the launches, etc.

Finally, in January of 2020 I started a new series called "Tech Notes" (named after Apple's technical documents of the same name) to allow me to write down quick thoughts on interesting problems I had come across in my own apps. They are always under 500 words, and allow me to share fun things without the stress of writing a "full" post.

Finally, the name itself is a mash up of the two predominant languages used to create iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS software. Swift and Objective-C. Additionally, the logo contains callbacks to both languages. The two brackets around the "SC" representing Objective-C and the trailing "()" representing Swift.

### Colophon
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}, a robust static site generator, is used to manage and create Swiftjective-C. It uses no existing theme and is rolled from scratch.

[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com){:target="_blank"} is my text editor of choice for web development. 

[Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org){:target="_blank"} is used for authoring each article.

[Pygments](http://pygments.org){:target="_blank"}, specifically the Monokai theme, is utilized for all code syntax highlighting.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com){:target="_blank"} handles domain management and all deployment of its source code. Without it, I'm not sure this site would exist. It's easily the most intuitive way I've found to get a website up and rolling.

[Github](https://www.github.com){:target="_blank"} is used for source control, and each article and the entire [source code for this site](https://github.com/DreamingInBinary/Swiftjective-C){:target="_blank"} is available there for collaboration and learning purposes. It's free to use and to change however you wish.
